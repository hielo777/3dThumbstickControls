# 3d Thumbstick Controls in Construct 3

This project showcases how to create a simple and effective thumbstick controller for 3D objects in Construct 3.

With 3 events, and some clever setting, the game can set the thumbstick controller, that can be used in any touch-screen device.

## Changes:

- Better Rotation of the 3D Object
I left 2 3D objects so the difference between the way to handle their rotation looks like.
In the next version I will eliminate the second object, and work on collisions, that way this would be the base of a 3D type of game.

- Re created the exported game files
