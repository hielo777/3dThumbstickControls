# 3d Thumbstick Controls in Construct 3

This project showcases how to create a simple and effective thumbstick controller for 3D objects in Construct 3.

With 3 events, and some clever setting, the game can set the thumbstick controller, that can be used in any touch-screen device.

## Changes:
- [x] Basic thumbstick functionality

- [x] Added tiled background to highlight 3D object movement

- [x] Improved the rotation of the 3D object reflecting the thumbstick movement

- [x] Added solid objects. This is to showcase the basics of a possible 3D based game using the thumbstick

- [x] Re created the exported game files

## To Do
- [ ] Integrate with basic 3D slopes
- [ ] Add second thumbstick functionality. Perhaps to control the camera to orbit the 3D object representing the main character
- [ ] Comment the .c3p document to clarify functionality
