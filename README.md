# 3d Thumbstick Controls in Construct 3

This project showcases how to create a simple and effective thumbstick controller for 3D objects in Construct 3.

With 3 events, and some clever setting, the game can set the thumbstick controller, that can be used in any touch-screen device.

## Changes:

- Added solid objects
This is to showcase the basics of a possible 3D based game using the thumbstick.

- Re created the exported game files
