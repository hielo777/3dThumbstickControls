# 3d Thumbstick Controls in Construct 3: Basic Version

This project showcases how to create a simple and effective thumbstick controller for 3D objects in Construct 3.

With 4 events, and some clever setting, the game can set the thumbstick controller, that can be used in any touch-screen device.

## 3d thumbstick controls Basic.c3p

The main version of this project offers more functionality than what was originally planned. This simplified version, found in this folder, provides a cleaner foundation that can be easily integrated into other projects.

## 3d thumbstick Bare Minimum.c3p

This is the bare minimum version of this project. The thumbstick directly moves the Player3D object, and the change in angle can be more jarring, reason why I added a playerBase object in more advanced versions.
